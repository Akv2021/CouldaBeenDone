# CouldaBeenDone
CouldaBeenDone turns procrastination into potential! It's not about guilt-tripping you into productivity; it's about making time awareness fun and motivating you to use your time more wisely. It's a playful, visual way to see the opportunities you could have taken and give your day that little nudge towards doing something more productive!
