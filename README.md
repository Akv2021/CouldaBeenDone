# CouldaBeenDone: Turn Wasted Time into "What-If" Productivity

Ever caught yourself thinking, "I've been scrolling for an hour... I could've watched an entire episode of Stranger Things by now!"? Or how much you could've learned instead of binge-watching YouTube? **CouldaBeenDone** is here to visualize those "could've, would've, should've" moments and turn them into motivation to make better use of those *"just five more minutes"*!

## What Is CouldaBeenDone?

CouldaBeenDone is not about tracking what you've actually done. Instead, it's a fun, light-hearted tool to see what you could have accomplished in the time you've spent... well, doing whatever it is you're doing (or not doing). It gives you a playful look at how time flies and encourages productivity, without the guilt.

### Perfect for:

* üõãÔ∏è **Couch Potatoes** ("That's two episodes of *The Office* I could've finished!")
* üìö **Procrastinating Students** ("Could've read three chapters of my textbook‚Ä¶ oops!")
* üéÆ **Gamers** ("I could've won two Fortnite matches in this time")
* üíº **Office Procrastinators** ("Four coffee breaks? I could've finished that report!")
* üéß **Learn-It-Alls** ("I could've finished that online course module in this time!")
* üíª **Aspiring Coders** ("That's one full coding tutorial I missed")
* üìñ **Book Enthusiasts** ("Could've read 50 pages of my novel by now")
* üßπ **Reluctant Cleaners** ("My room could've been spotless in this time!")

## How Does It Work?

1. **Add Fun "Tasks"**: Enter activities you'd like to do or feel like you should be doing (like watching a show, going for a walk, or learning something new).
2. **Start the Timer**: Hit **Start** and let it track how much time passes.
3. **Watch the Progress**: See what activities you could've done instead of scrolling, binge-watching, or procrastinating.
4. **Get Motivated**: Use those "I could've done that?" moments as motivation to get things done.
